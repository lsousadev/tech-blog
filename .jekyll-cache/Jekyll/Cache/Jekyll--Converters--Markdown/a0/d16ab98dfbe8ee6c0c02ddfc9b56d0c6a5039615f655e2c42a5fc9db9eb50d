<h3 id="39-public-key-infrastructure">3.9 Public key infrastructure</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Concepts:
    <ul>
      <li>Chaining: Intermediate certificates are often listed between a web server‚Äôs SSL certificate and the root certificate. This list of intermediate certificates is called a ‚Äúchain.‚Äù It‚Äôs important to configure web servers with the proper chain, or the end user may receive an error in their browser that the server can‚Äôt be trusted.</li>
      <li>Key escrow: use a trusted third party to store a copy of the decryption keys.</li>
      <li>If a custom CA is used for signing a certificate for a server, the client must have that custom CA‚Äôs certificate installed in order to successfully verify the certificate‚Äôs validity.</li>
      <li>OCSP stapling: with OCSP, it is challenging to keep checking back with the CA to see if a certificate is still valid. OSCP stapling solves that by storing certificate status information locally, so local validation can be performed instead of having to communicate with the CA every time. It is a method that has the certificate holder verify their own certificate status. The OCSP status is commonly ‚Äústapled‚Äù into the SSL handshake process. Since the status information is digitally signed by the CA, its validity can be trusted.</li>
      <li>Offline CA: common way to prevent the exploitation of a root authority.</li>
      <li>Pinning: embeds a service‚Äôs certificate inside of an application. When the application contacts the service, the service certificate will be compared to the pinned certificate. If the certificates match, the application knows that it can trust the service.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>PKI: describes the processes and procedures associated with maintaining digital certificates.
    <ul>
      <li>CA (Certificate Authority): the administrative control for any public key infrastructure deployment. Deploys and manages certificates.</li>
      <li>CSR (Certificate Signing Request): used during key creation process. Public key is sent to CA to be signed as part of CSR.</li>
      <li>CRL (Certificate Revocation List): a file containing a list of the revoked certificates. This list is maintained by the associated certificate authority.</li>
      <li>Hierarchical CA: design that includes intermediate CAs to distribute certificate management load.</li>
      <li>OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol): protocol used by the browser to check the revocation status of a certificate.</li>
      <li>RA (Registration Authority): works with the certificate authority to identify and authenticate the certificate requester. Verifies the entity requesting the certificate.</li>
      <li>x.509: defines the structure of digital certificates. It makes it easy for everyone to view the contents of a certificate.</li>
